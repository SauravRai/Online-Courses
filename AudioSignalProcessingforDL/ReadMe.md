* "For understanding Timbre, just think of two instruments (violin and piano) being played at the same frequency, pitch, scale, and intensity. Now take the difference of these two sounds and that is your timbre. Timbre is synonymous with colour in audio.”

Please note that “Timber” is a term used for wood, especially when it is suitable for building or carpentry. In the context of music, the term you’re looking for is “Timbre”, which refers to the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes different types of sound production, such as voices or musical instruments. The term “Timbre” is often likened to the ‘colour’ of a sound.
