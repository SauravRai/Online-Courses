Course: Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments
*******************************************************************************

-> Nearly all embedded systems contain a processing core like a micro controlle and these require the design of low level software in order to function.
   However, software design is just one piece of the embedded system that a software engineer must be familiar with. 

-> You must start with the environment you design in or the development platform. The development platform components include a host machine, a development environment to write and test code in.
   A compiler toolchain to generate designs, development kits to integrate with, and version control to track software history. 

-> This course starts by first defining all parts of the Embedded Systems including the enviroment, hardware and software. 
   
-> SCM indicates how you will organize and manage software project. 

-> We'll be spending a lot of time compiling software with a GCC Tool chain and GNU Make.
   With the tool chain we'll be able to break up our build process and analyze compiled code. We then finish up the module with low level concepts of memory systems for
   our embedded architecture.    
   This includes memory systems, software to hardware memory interface, and writing code for different program segments. 

-> Goal of the course: Develop both portable and architecture specific software for embedded systems in C-programming.
