Introduction to Memory Organization

-> Registers, code memory, and data memory fundamentally require different physical characteristics. There are many features that we   
   want for memory, such as high capacity, low power, low latency, and high reliability. The closer to the CPU the memory is, the faster you need it to be.      However, these features often come at a price, and it forces us to utilize different types of memories. Some with low latencies, also with smaller          capacities. Therefore, you usually build a hierarchy of memory systems to help with this. If you need more memory, or a different capability, you may have    to change chipsets as with different hardware. This is why multiple chips were offered in a subset family with varying amounts of internal memory          capability. So they meet a variety of applications with different price points.
