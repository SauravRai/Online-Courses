Transformation is a fancy word for function. It takes input as vector and spits out output as some vector. 

So why to use the word transformation instead of function? 

To visualize the input and output relation. Moving input vector to output vector.
 
In Linear algebra, we restrict to just linear functions/transformations: The linear thing has two properties. 

(1) Lines remains lines 

(2) Origin remains fixed. 

In general, we can say that linear of the Grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced so that origin remains fixed. 

Examples are shear, rotation around the center. 

Bonus point: think and visualize Matrices as Tranformations that will be the base for Linear Algebra.

Lecture 6: The determinant (think in terms of area as how much it scaled/increases/decreases, it is determined by the determinant)

It has magnitude which tells us as about how much it has scaled and the positive/negatives tells us about the orientation after the transformation.

Note: When the determinant is 0, it means the Columns must be linearly dependent as the transformed vector will be in a line :)
      Negative determinant meanning the orientation is flipped. 
      Positive determinant meaning the area is scaled by some factor.
