1. Vector DB is the place where we store embeddings. 
2. What is Langchain? 
- LangChain is an open-source framework designed to make it easier to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT. 
It provides tools, abstractions, and integrations that help developers connect LLMs with:
    External data (files, databases, APIs)
    Reasoning tools (search engines, code execution, agents)
    Application logic (chains, workflows)

- Components to build the production grade application. 
- Example: Models are like car engine, but programmers need APIs/connectivity to interact with models and data. That framework is called as
  Langchain.
- Unified interface like Hugging face where you can find everything like different models for different applications and everything. Single place to get
  everything.
- LLMS gives you output distributions and it does sampling operation so the responses are always varying. Temperature parameter value if it more than 0 then the
  responses are more dynamic and not static.

langchain_openai is the package that connects the Langchain framework with OpenAi's models and services for building AI applications.
